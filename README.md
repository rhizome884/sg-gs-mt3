SampleGuitar-GuitarSet-MT3: A partition of the SampleGuitar2026 dataset that features GuitarSet symbolic data with MIDI velocity estimates generated using a velocity sensitive CRNN guitar transcription model. MT3 refers to the GuitarSet dataset split, in which the 1st and 2nd chord progressions are used as the train split, and the 3rd progression is used as the test split.

## Notes
The dataset does not contain the 2 annotations with timing errors. I had corrected these annotations, but I'd need to process them with the CRNN to produce velocity estimates, and I don't have time for the sake of 4 short midi files.
